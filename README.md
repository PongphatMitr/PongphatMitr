## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a junior student in Information and Communication Technology at Mahidol University, major in database and intelligence system. I live by the motto that innovators are not bound by existing ideas. Proficient in data engineering and machine learning development, as well as Python programming, I am driven to leverage these skills to become a data engineer. My goal is to contribute innovative solutions in the dynamic field of technology, combining analytical prowess with programming expertise.
